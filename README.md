# Conversor: Currency Exchange App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## `Introduction`

Hello and Welcome! After going through some courses on freeCodeCamp, this was my first ever attempt at building an App from scratch. 

At this point, I had learnt how to code for 3-4 months. As I was working full time, I had to maximize my free time (Evenings and Weekends) and put in a lot of effort to create this.

## `Tools`

You may be wondering what tools were used for this basic application. I just had learnt the basics of React and wanted to use it for my first project.

Therefore, the tools that were used for this project are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React.

Since then, I have become familar with using Next JS, Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS, which were used in other projects.
